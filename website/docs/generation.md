The integration will be created and you will be returned to the same page. In the Integration Keys
section you will see Integration ID, this is the id you will use below when initiating a transaction, note
this id is unique to the integration not your account, if you have more than one integration you will

transactions on the live account and that any other developers will no longer know the Integration
